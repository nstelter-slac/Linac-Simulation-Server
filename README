Simulated Linac using Cheetah and PCASpy

This project provides a simulated EPICS server that hosts PVs using PCASpy. The simulation is designed to work with the Cheetah accelerator framework and includes examples for interfacing with the lcls-tools.

Setup Instructions

To set up and run the simulated server, follow these steps:

Create the environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml

Activate the environment:

conda activate linac-simulation

Source the setup script:

source setup.sh

Run the simulated server:

python simulated_server.py

Examples:

This repository includes example scripts demonstrating how to interface with the simulated EPICS server using the lcls-tools module, which is available in the provided environment. These examples illustrate how to read from and write to process variables (PVs).

Dependencies:

The required dependencies are listed in environment.yml, ensuring a reproducible setup. The environment includes:

PCASpy for hosting EPICS PVs

Cheetah for beam simulation

lcls-tools for interfacing with EPICS

Notes:

Ensure that all dependencies are installed properly and that the setup script is sourced before running the server to avoid missing environment variables or paths.

For any issues, verify that the required environment is activated and that caget and caput can communicate with the hosted PVs.

You will also need to provide your own beam distribution (this setup is designed to run on the LCLS-I Cu Injector)
